# Han-Solo's website

This is my final project for "Web Developer" course at Coderhouse.

**Live:** https://han-solo.netlify.app

## What I did 👇
- I made it from scratch, using HTML and CSS with [SASS](https://sass-lang.com/).
- I integrated [animate.css](https://animate.style/) for some animated effects.
- Later on I integrated [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) for a fast and responsive menu.

## What I learned ☝
- How to properly use CSS grid-based layout system.
- When and how to use CSS flexbox layout.
- Responsive techniques like mobile-first concepts.
- Grid system of Bootstrap.

### Final notes 🗒
- I was qualified as a Top 10 student for this project.
- I'm not very satisfied with the look and design that I did, although it was not gradeable in the course.
